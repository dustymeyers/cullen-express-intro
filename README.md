# Cullen Express Intro

Gonna be great... :

.json (javascript object notation) - used for configuration to track information about the project

1. In Terminal initialize as a node project repo "npm init"
2. Terminal will check for what the defaults are, return through each until it checks if it's okay
3. in terminal run "npm install express"

- adds dependencies: "express" : "^4.17.1"
  - at least version 4.17.1
- new folder called node modules
  - This is where we can find the express file which is a new LIBRARY FOR US TO USE!!!

4. now we need to tell git to ignore the node_modules

- .gitignore
- Tell this file to ignore node_modules
